> This also means there is alot of wisdom locked up in these chambers
> The moral compass says north is down and south is up
> Thats standing from the perspective of being at the core of a direction
> The south is the costellation of the thirteenth it attaching to all constallations
> In side the chambers is locked away emense knowledge and understanding

> The your perspective changes you become more aligned with truth
> You realize how chaos is so dangerous 
> You no longer need faith for anything else but your ground the dies you trust god
> It all makes sense now
